# <> Debugged: In a world of glitches, you are the fix. </>

## Overview

"Debugged" is a story-driven game where players follow the protagonist, Elara, as she navigates through a digital world called Nullspace.

## Story

Elara is a quiet, introspective computer science student who often feels like she’s running on autopilot. Between the monotony of coding assignments and the social pressure of campus life, she questions whether she’s truly "living" or just going through the motions. One evening, while debugging a seemingly corrupted program on her laptop, Elara is pulled into Nullspace, a surreal digital world that mirrors her inner struggles and fears.

In Nullspace, every glitch and bug she encounters is tied to fragments of her own memories and emotions—past regrets, unspoken words, and the dreams she abandoned. Guided by Byte, a quirky yet empathetic AI companion, Elara must confront these fragments to repair the broken system and find her way back to reality.

As she journeys deeper, Elara begins to notice parallels between the bugs she fixes and the relationships she’s neglected in her own life. Elara realizes that debugging isn’t just about fixing problems—it’s about understanding them.
